## 1.Network Configuration
Aerospike Databases' Network configuration stanza sets up critical network ports to be used by other nodes, application, and tools. The following table lists and describes ports used by Aerospike Database and XDR:

Name	| Default Port |	Description

Service	3000	Application, Tools, and Remote XDR use the Service port for database operations and cluster state.

Fabric	3001	Intra-cluster communication port. Replica writes, migrations, and other node-to-node communications use the Fabric port.

Mesh Heartbeat	3002	Heartbeat protocol ports are used to form and maintain the cluster. (Only one heartbeat port may be configured.)

Multicast Heartbeat	9918	Heartbeat protocol ports are used to form and maintain the cluster. (Only one heartbeat port may be configured.)

Info	3003	Telnet port that implements a plain text protocol for administrators to issue info commands. For more information, see asinfo documentation.


## 2.Namespace Configuration

The minimum requirement for configuring a namespace is to provide a namespace-name. This will create an in memory 
namespace by that name with a 4GB capacity. The configuration would be similar to the following, the commented parameters 
indicate the defaults.

```
namespace <namespace-name> {
    # memory-size 4G           # 4GB of memory to be used for index and data
    # replication-factor 2     # For multiple nodes, keep 2 copies of the data
    # high-water-memory-pct 60 # Evict non-zero TTL data if capacity exceeds
                               # 60% of 4GB
    # stop-writes-pct 90       # Stop writes if capacity exceeds 90% of 4GB
    # default-ttl 0            # Writes from client that do not provide a TTL
                               # will default to 0 or never expire
    # storage-engine memory    # Store data in memory only
}
```
