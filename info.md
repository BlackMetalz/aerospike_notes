1. What is Aerospike
```
Aerospike is a distributed database supporting key-value store and document-oriented data models. 
Aerospike is architected to meet the performance needs of today’s web-scale applications—providing robustness and 
strong consistency with no downtime.
```

2. Why Aerospike
- Unmatched Reliability:
```
Aerospike uniquely combines proven uptime, predictable high performance combined with strong consistency and durability for 
a robust database architecture enterprises need.
```

- Superior Scalability:
```
Aerospike’s dynamic cluster management and unique flexible storage engine enable our database to reliably handle millions 
of transactions per second, efficiently scaling to meet any data volume needs.
```

- Exceptionally Low TCO:
```
Fueled by a hybrid-flash architecture and automated cluster management, Aerospike provides improved performance at 20% the 
total cost of ownership (TCO) of first-generation NoSQL and relational databases.
```

- Deployable Anywhere:
```
Easily deployable as Linux on bare-metal, on-premises, in the cloud or any combination thereof – often within minutes. 
Can be deployed for both front-end systems of engagement or backend systems of record.
```

3. Key Feature:
- Strong Consistency: No data loss. Commit-to-device support for demanding correctness environments.
- Cross Datacenter Replication (XDR): Geographic replication of data by synchronizing datacenters through high 
performance replication.
- Hybrid Memory Architecture: Store data with traditional in-memory, unique Hybrid-Flash, 
or All-Flash storage architecture to optimize for performance and scale.
- Compression: Provides lossless compression of records written to persistent storage.
- High Availability & Uptime: High availability and a demonstrated uptime of five 9s or more which is made possible 
by a unique cluster management and intelligent client technology in addition to local/remote replication.
- Smart Client: Automatically distributes both data and traffic to all the nodes in a cluster. 
Automatic load balancing of the client improves both performance and correctness.
- Dynamic Cluster Management: Automatic storage and exchange of node information including changes and status with 
automated triggers for rebalancing.
- Change Notification: Inject change notifications into message queues, or insert them into other databases for 
reliable and scalable systems.
- Multi-Model: Easy-to-program data structures such as lists and maps improve performance and allow indexed lookups 
on field values.
- Enterprise Security: Full transport encryption. Support for encrypted storage and in-database transparent data encryption.
Authentication, access control, and exception logging.
